# Django App for Machine Learning API
To create a Django app for an ML model with the provided workflow, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Setup Django Environment
#### 1.1 Install Django
```bash
pip install django
```
#### 1.2 Create new Django project
```bash
django-admin startproject ml_api_project
```
#### 1.3 Create new Django app
```bash
cd ml_api_project
python manage.py startapp ml_api
```

### 2. Build Models
#### 2.1 Create first model
Define fields and write methods in `ml_api/models.py`.

#### 2.2 Create second model
Define fields and write methods in `ml_api/models.py`.

### 3. Create Views
#### 3.1 Create view for first model
Define request methods and response format in `ml_api/views.py`.

#### 3.2 Create view for second model
Define request methods and response format in `ml_api/views.py`.

### 4. Setup URL routes
#### 4.1 Add route for first model view
Configure URL routing in `ml_api/urls.py`.

#### 4.2 Add route for second model view
Configure URL routing in `ml_api/urls.py`.

### 5. Integrate Machine Learning API
Connect to the ML API, test the connection, and implement API calls in views.

### 6. Test Django App
#### 6.1 Test models
Test the functionality of models.

#### 6.2 Test views
Test the views by making requests and checking responses.

#### 6.3 Test URL routes
Test the URL routes to ensure they direct traffic correctly.
